# aoc2021
My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021 - my first year of attempting the challenges. Currently in Clojure, might jump ship to JavaScript when it gets too hard as this is close to my first forray into this brave new paren-filled world.

## Running these
I developed these using [Conjure](https://github.com/olical/conjure), which connects nvim to a repl (started with `clm -m nrepl.cmdline -M --middleware "cider.nrepl/cider-middleware" --interactive`) - you'd have to wrap the relevant forms in a `println` if you wanted to simply run and see the output.
